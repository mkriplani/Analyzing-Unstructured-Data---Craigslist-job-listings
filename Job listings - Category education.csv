Turning Sun Schools is hiring Lead, Classroom, and Substitute Educators at our locations in East Lake, North Druid Hills, Tucker, and Smoke Rise to work with students ages 3 months - 5 years.  Staff are typically salaried which includes being paid for the 40-45 weekdays we are closed each year (we follow public school schedules). Full time staff are eligible for health insurance benefits and optional retirement plan. Full time staff can work 8-4, 9-5, or 10-6 depending on location. Part time and Substitute Educator positions also offer flexible hours and schedule based on need between 8-6 Mon-Fri year round.  Turning Sun is the school you always wished you could have attended. Our approach is play-based and inspired by the Reggio Emilia philosophy. Our curriculum is child-driven and always respectful to our students. We go outside EVERY day to connect with the natural world, and often explore the history, culture, and art of our local communities. We are a non-religious, open and affirming community which welcomes families and staff regardless of gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, creed, or ethnicity.  Education and experience are a plus, but not a requirement because all of our staff progress through Turning Sun's Professional Development Program. We seek candidates who possess the things we cannot teach: (1) ""character"" which aligns with our special values and (2) the natural ability to connect with children.  New employees will also need CPR/First Aid certification (which we will provide and fund) and a comprehensive background check (which we can guide you through). TSS promotes from within so that all staff have opportunities for advancement and growth, and even the possibility to open their own school.

(Ex: care packages, back to school drives/giveaways, food drives, clothing drives, hygiene kits)    -Online Learning Enrichment Programs: Over 200 Courses (Microsoft courses, Cyber security, Biz management, Project Management, Technology, Finance (understanding your 401k/IRA, Retirement planning).    -Parental Legacy Program: Gives $900 per month per child in child support & $24,000 for high education per child, if orphaned.    -Scholarship Program: 300+ Scholarships given away annually- $10,000 each ($2500 for 4 years)    -Fun Family Events: Allows you to apply to go to fun attractions for free with your family and other local policy owners (Ex: Kings Dominion, Busch Gardens, Six Flags, Regional Baseball or basketball games, The Zoo or Aquarium, etc.)     All of these programs cost the individual absolutely nothing. That is why knowledge is so important to our community.  We believe everyone should know about this. Unfortunately, the percentage in the actual community that is aware of this, is less than 1%. We desire to change that... significantly. And make a difference in our community.   We have been in operation over 13 years, serving our community. The need is great, so we are looking for help. This is a 1099 position (independent and completely flexible schedule based on when you want to work).  This position is best for people looking for part time work. It's ideal for those that have limited availability but need to make the hours count. This allows people to make great money on the side because our model teaches the average part timer how to realistically make $24,000-$31,500 on the side.   We only promote from within so for those that are truly passionate about this movement, there are ways to grow significantly in title, responsibility, and income within the company. Entire divisions will be needing more leadership as we continue to grow and that pays well into six figures plus ownership rights.  To apply:  Set up a time in our schedule for an initial interview (5-10 min). We look forward to speaking to you. https://calendly.com/jhazzmanmartin"

Who we are: We are a Black Owned Organization that focuses on spreading awareness of several 501(c)8 Not-For-Profit programs/benefits/resources that was created to support and give a helping hand to underprivileged communities, yet isn’t being fully utilized simply because most don’t know they exist. We are passionate about teaching people how to have more resources come into our communities to make a difference.   Some of the Free Not-For-Profit 501(c)8 Programs:  - Community Grants: funding to plan and organize, hands on, one day volunteer activities in your community, multiple times per year - up to $2000 max. (Ex: care packages, back to school drives/giveaways, food drives, clothing drives, hygiene kits)  - Online Learning Program: Over 200 Courses (Microsoft courses, Cyber security, Biz management, Project Management, Technology, Finance (understanding your 401k/IRA, Retirement planning).  - Parental Legacy Program: Gives $900 per month per child in child support & $24,000 for high education per child, if orphaned.  - Scholarship Program: 300+ Scholarships given away annually- $10,000 each ($2500 for 4 years)  - Fun Family Events: Allows you to apply to go to fun attractions for free with your family and other local policy owners (Ex: Kings Dominion, Busch Gardens, Six Flags, Regional Baseball or basketball games, The Zoo or Aquarium, etc.)   All of these programs costs the individual absolutely nothing. That is why knowledge is so important to our community.  We believe everyone should know about this. Unfortunately, the percentage in the actual community that is aware of this, is less than 4%. We desire to change that... significantly. And make a difference in our community. We have been in operation over 13 years, serving our community. The need is great, so we are looking for help. This is a 1099 position (independent and completely flexible schedule based on when you want to work).  This position is best for people looking for part time work. It's ideal for those that have limited availability but need to make the hours count. This allows people to make great money on the side because our model teaches the average part timer how to realistically make $24,000-$31,500 on the side. We only promote from within so for those that are truly passionate about this movement, there are ways to grow significantly in title, responsibility, and income within the company. Entire divisions will be needing more leadership as we continue to grow and that pays well into six figures plus ownership rights.

We are passionate about teaching people how to have more resources come into our communities to make a difference.   Some of the Free Not-For-Profit 501(c)8 Programs:   -Community Grants: funding to plan and organize, hands on, one day volunteer activities in your community, multiple times per year - up to $2000 max. (Ex: care packages, back to school drives/giveaways, food drives, clothing drives, hygiene kits)   -Online Learning Enrichment Programs: Over 200 Courses (Microsoft courses, Cyber security, Biz management, Project Management, Technology, Finance (understanding your 401k/IRA, Retirement planning).   -Parental Legacy Program: Gives $900 per month per child in child support & $24,000 for high education per child, if orphaned.   -Scholarship Program: 300+ Scholarships given away annually- $10,000 each ($2500 for 4 years)   -Fun Family Events: Allows you to apply to go to fun attractions for free with your family and other local policy owners (Ex: Kings Dominion, Busch Gardens, Six Flags, Regional Baseball or basketball games, The Zoo or Aquarium, etc.)   All of these programs cost the individual absolutely nothing. That is why knowledge is so important to our community. We believe everyone should know about this. Unfortunately, the percentage in the actual community that is aware of this, is less than 1%. We desire to change that... significantly. And make a difference in our community.   We have been in operation over 13 years, serving our community. The need is great, so we are looking for help. This is a 1099 position (independent and completely flexible schedule based on when you want to work). This position is best for people looking for part time work. It's ideal for those that have limited availability but need to make the hours count. This allows people to make great money on the side because our model teaches the average part timer how to realistically make $24,000-$31,500 on the side.   We only promote from within so for those that are truly passionate about this movement, there are ways to grow significantly in title, responsibility, and income within the company. Entire divisions will be needing more leadership as we continue to grow and that pays well into six figures plus ownership rights.

Theater position works with nursery to second grade campers -- includes drama and dance. Fully covered stage, but open on all sides. Second grade campers put on a weekly performance. There is a large supply of teaching aides, costumes, props, to help with the program. We have a curriculum for the area, but new ideas are always welcome.   We have a curriculum in place, but we always welcome new ideas.   See Ramapo Country Day Camp in action and apply on our website: www.ramapocamp.com     Apply at: https://ramapocamp.com/staff-application/  All our activity areas are outdoors. All the non-sports areas have covered decks, that get a break from the sun or rain, but are open-air in the sights and sounds of camp. Our staff and campers are inside enough in school. We get everyone outside.  Employment application is available on the website.   Ramapo Country Day Camp is a 35-acre site located on the Bergen/Rockland County border near the towns of Ridgewood, Woodcliff Lake, Upper Saddle River, Montvale, and Suffern. We are easily accessible by The Garden State Parkway (Exit 172), Rt. 17 (Saddle River/Woodcliff Lk Exit), I-287, The Palisades Pkwy, The NY State Thruway (exit 14B), and Rt. 59.  Our campers range in age from 3 to 12 (Nursery to Seventh Grade) and they participate in activities ranging from Art, swim, all sports, theater, rock climbing, zip lines, go carts, and archery to pioneering, nature, horseback riding, hands-on-science, and rocketry. Our campers come from all over Bergen County and Manhattan (NYC).  Our staff is made up of teachers (specialists) from Bergen, Passaic, Rockland County and New York City Schools who run our activity areas. College students work as counselors accompanying each group of campers and assisting our teachers.  Camp Dates: June 26th to August 18th (39 total days)  The camp program runs Monday to Friday 9:00am to 3:30pm   About Our Facility:   The best way is to see it at: www.ramapocamp.com   Different than school where the field, court, or classroom is one size fits all; we can build our fields, courts, and ""classroom"" to fit the age, size, strength, and ability level of our campers. This way a field is never too big or too small for a camper. Right when they are ready to outgrow a field they move up to a new size. Our camp classrooms are designed with a specific use - they are not converted or adapted to be used for something different so we have put thought into how the tables are designed so every seat is a good seat and the teacher (specialist) can easily be accessible to everyone. So much thought is put into the design the educator in you will appreciate the attention to detail since it will benefit your campers. Every program area has been built to take advantage of the outdoors. So campers and staff are not inside like they are during school. There is plenty of cover from the sun, but the fresh-air says we are outside and not in-school.   Our campers are too young to hate any activity. Who did that to them? So it is our job to re-present the activity in a way so they can experience some success and want to keep coming back. We want to create momentum with every visit. As momentum builds, so does confidence. When the confidence comes then break through moments occur.     About Our Staff:   As nice and well thought out as our facility is, it's all about the people. The staff are who our campers will be talking about at the dinner table each evening. Our staff are the momentum makers that will be impacting our campers everyday.   We have worked hard to create a facility and staff-working environment that is enjoyable, creative, positive, and perfect for the summer. You will enjoy coming to work each day. Many of our teachers return each year, but we are always welcome new energetic people. We are looking for people who would rather do more than less and who see working at camp as something they ""get to do"" not ""have to do"".  Teachers, we call specialists, run our activity areas. Each camper group comes with 2-4 college counselors who stay with the group and assist the specialists when they arrive at the area.    Many of our specialists, coaches and teachers work in Bergen, Passaic & Rockland County Schools.

There are also a few positions open that can work with non-consecutive weeks.   Our 35 acre facility has riding rings, new stables, and riding trails.   Job Description:   Ramapo's horseback riding program is the perfect blend of English Riding and camp fun.  Campers will learn basic riding skills in a setting that allows for growth as a rider.  Lessons also include time for games to reinforce skills and build a rapport between rider and horse. Instructors need to have comfort and confidence teaching students basic English riding skills ....from mounting and dismounting, teaching full seat, half seat and posting at the walk, as well as teaching steering and some trotting. We also spend time outside of the corrals on the camp’s trails!   Instructors will also teach basic horsemanship to campers as well.  Instructors will be expected to work with the team to care for the horses for the duration of camp, as the horses live on the camp grounds.  This includes feeding, grooming and care of the horses on a daily basis, as well as cleaning stalls.  Instructors will also be working with the camp's horse care program, which teaches campers about horses, horsemanship, grooming, tacking, and care of horses etc.  The team makes plans for horse care each week that do not include riding. We are looking for instructors who will bring positive energy to the team, is a team player, and is willing to invest themselves in our horses and our campers for the summer.    Campers ride once a week for 30 minutes working mostly with the same instructor and on the same horse. So our instructors really get to know their campers. The campers really get to know you and establish an equal connection with their horse. The program is basically a beginner to intermediate level. Most of the campers in the program had their first experience riding at Ramapo.   We also offer a horse care program. This is offered during the choice times in the camper's schedule (called electives) where the same campers would go to horse care for an hour, everyday, for five days. Since the campers have chosen to be there they are very interested in learning everything they can about the horses and the instructors have more time to go into more detail.  Our instructors can share all their knowledge and love of horses with these campers. We have a written curriculum for the program so there is a plan to follow, but we are always looking for new ideas to further enhance the program.

We can provide you with an environment that will give you a chance to work with children on a daily basis and let you gain even more classroom experience. You will be working with people who share your passion for teaching. I was in your shoes at one time as an education major who was looking for any opportunity to practice my teaching and coaching skills. Camp gave me the perfect place to get that practice. Everything I was learning in my education classes I could put into practice during the summer. It made all the difference and helped me going into my first interviews and my first teaching job in Bergen County.   We can help prepare you for your future career in education by: 1)	Giving you experience with a specific age group. 2)	Helping you discover what age group is ideal for you.  3)	Helping you get comfortable with a grade you had previously thought would not be a fit.   4)	Gaining more confidence running your own classroom, with behavior management, and how children go about           learning.   5)	Getting you coaching from the experienced teachers and school administrators who work at camp.  6)	Helping you make a connection with those same principals and teachers who are at Ramapo that may also be           looking for talented teachers to join their school staff.  7)	Giving you specific experiences beyond student teaching to talk about in your teaching interviews. It will show          those who will one day interview you that you sought out as many teaching environments as you could to make           yourself a better educator.  8)	Being around others who share your enthusiasm for the teaching profession.    2023 Camp Dates: June 26th to August 18th.

Our campers come from all over Bergen County and Manhattan (NYC).  Our staff is made up of teachers (specialists) from Bergen, Passaic, Rockland County and New York City Schools who run our activity areas. College students work as counselors accompanying each group of campers and assisting our teachers.

We also have a sports coordinator who will make sure you have all the support you need to run the program you have envisioned.  About Our Facility:   The best way is to see it at: www.ramapocamp.com   Different than school where the field, court, or classroom is one size fits all; we can build our fields, courts, and ""classroom"" to fit the age, size, strength, and ability level of our campers. This way a field is never too big or too small for a camper. Right when they are ready to outgrow a field they move up to a new size. Our camp classrooms are designed with a specific use - they are not converted or adapted to be used for something different.   Our campers are too young to hate any activity. Who did that to them? So it is our job to re-present the activity in a way so they can experience some success and want to keep coming back. We want to create momentum with every visit. As momentum builds, so does confidence. When the confidence comes then break through moments occur.   About Our Staff:   As nice and well thought out as our facility is, it's all about the people. The staff are who our campers will be talking about at the dinner table each evening. Our staff are the momentum makers that will be impacting our campers everyday.   We have worked hard to create a facility and staff-working environment that is enjoyable, creative, positive, and perfect for the summer. You will enjoy coming to work each day. Many of our teachers return each year, but we are always welcome new energetic people. We are looking for people who would rather do more than less and who see working at camp as something they ""get to do"" not ""have to do"".  Teachers, we call specialists, run our activity areas. Each camper group comes with 2-4 college counselors who stay with the group and assist the specialists when they arrive at the area.    Many of our specialists, coaches and teachers work in Bergen, Passaic, and Rockland County Schools. Camp is also a great place to not only work with people who share your passion and commitment to teaching/coaching, but also to make connections with people in the area. You never know where a connection will take you.  We welcome any questions you may have please call or e-mail us with them.   Interviews are held via: Zoom, FaceTime, or in-person  Call or e-mail Brian or Marc for more information.

https://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/edu/d/new-york-musician-artist-mentor/7554984362.html,Musician/Artist/Mentor/Behaviorist for College Student,newyork,edu,"QR Code Link to This Post   I am looking for sincere, earnest, dedicated people to work with my Autism Spectrum son in a number of areas. The job entails teaching my son various life skills, such as how to interact appropriately with other people, how to keep his apartment and himself neat and clean and how to travel safely and independently in the community.   My son, who has a degree in Biochemistry at City College, is gifted and intelligent.  He has always had an enormous thirst for learning, and an impressive ability to acquire and assimilate knowledge. The mentor’s role is to help him (and motivate him) to stay focused, communicate with other people appropriately and develop his sense of self and his place in the world, while also supporting him in his various intellectual and artistic pursuits (and vice versa).  One of our overarching goals is to work with him and his other mentors on figuring out an appropriate career path for him.  Since the best way to reach Benjamin is through learning, it would be great (but not necessary) to find a mentor with a knowledge of music, science, computers, yoga, art, phonology and/or foreign languages.  My son has been studying violin for several years and has been developing a classical repertoire.  He recently started studying guitar, drumming, and piano.   He excels in the visual arts.  Musicians and artists have been successful teaching giving him lessons in Art, Chinese and Italian.    I want to emphasize that this is a long-term job, with the potential for more responsibility and more hours, depending on the mentor’s interest in and ability and commitment to working with my son. I also want to be careful not to mislead applicants by putting too much emphasis on my son's academic and artistic gifts: his deficits in the area of attention and communication are significant and just as great as, if not greater than, his gifts.   I am not trying to make my son into a Renaissance man.  The teaching is merely a means to an end--that end being figuring out a way to teach Ben social and communication skills, which are very backward.  I am just as interested in finding people with a knowledge of behaviorism and an interest or career in working with people on the Spectrum. Working on B's deficits is the ultimate goal of all our work with him. The Pandemic has come bearing its own hefty share of challenges for my son. Helping deal with the trauma of it is an important focus of everyone's work with him.   This is very much a collaborative effort, and can be inspiring and rewarding, depending on what you value as a human being. It can also be very frustrating, if this is not your thing.    What I have been trying to do is build a community of like-minded, deep-feeling people, devoted to helping my son develop the skills necessary for him to make use of his considerable intelligence and gifts, the ultimate goal being to give him a chance to live a happy and productive life and one that is as independent as possible.  That is why I have been placing this ad on Craigslist very month!   It is essential that working with my son be as rewarding for his mentors, as it is for him.   The hours are flexible, as is the start date.  If you have answered this ad before, please do so again. Since there are some shifts that are now opening up.  My son lives in Washington Heights, right next to the A train.  Please send your resume to Maxine at:  mentorforcollegestudent@gmail.com"

Hello!   We are seeking a candidate who is able to teach BOTH physics and calculus to contribute to a small, local, non-corporate learning center where you will get to know our staff and students and become a member of a dynamic, cheerful, and collaborative team of instructors who tutor students of all ages and skill levels in a variety of academic subjects and standardized tests. All tutoring is exclusively one-on-one and compensation is very competitive. We do not provide group tutoring. At the moment, most of our sessions are currently conducted online, but we hope to eventually return to in-person tutoring at our learning center.  We are seeking candidates who can apply a Socratic approach to teaching. A big part of what we do effectively is customize our approach for each student and adjust our methods to align with the learning profile of individual personalities and their unique attributes, thus making patience, as well as strong listening and interpersonal skills, central to our success.  When we see students in person, tutoring is conducted in a quiet, casual atmosphere where we work one-on-one with elementary, middle school, and high school students for an hour at a time. Currently, we also provide home and school visits for students. Until we return to in-person tutoring, training and tutoring will take place online, so candidates are required to have reliable access to a laptop or desktop computer with camera, printer, and consistent and strong internet service.  We have opportunities for candidates with availability to tutor as few as 6 hours a week to as many as 20-plus. We only accept applicants who can start immediately, have strong interpersonal skills, and are willing to make a firm commitment for the entirety of this school year (to the end of June of 2023).

The ideal applicant is flexible and will be comfortable teaching several subjects and/or tests, and also enjoy working with students of varying ages. Background working with children (such as camp counselor) is valuable, and competency in a wide range of subjects is a big plus.  This position is often a good fit for students enrolled in a graduate program, as well as those who have another focus, such as stay-at-home parents, artists, dancers, writers, waitstaff, etc. seeking part-time hours. As long as you can commit to consistent days and are punctual we will work with your schedule.  Along with your resume, please include a cover letter or email describing:  The specific subjects or tests you are comfortable teaching, e.g., English, history, calc, chem, biology, physics, SAT, ACT, etc. Your availability each day of the week, including times and explaining Saturday and Sunday availability The number of hours a week you would like to tutor Confirm you live in the New York City area Your ability to commit to the end of the school year in June of 2023 We offer highly competitive compensation and flexible hours but, more importantly, an environment in which we support and respect our instructors and strive to make our work with students fun and satisfying.

Enthusiasm, a positive attitude, and punctuality are prerequisites.  If you appear to be a good match for our learning center we will follow up immediately.

We are seeking an instructor who is able to teach BOTH physics and calculus to contribute to a small, local, non-corporate learning center where you will get to know our staff and students and become a member of a dynamic, cheerful, and collaborative team of instructors who tutor students of all ages and skill levels in a variety of academic subjects and standardized tests. All tutoring is exclusively one-on-one and compensation is very competitive. We do not provide group tutoring. At the moment, most of our sessions are currently conducted online, but we hope to eventually return to in-person tutoring at our learning center.  We are seeking candidates who can apply a Socratic approach to teaching. A big part of what we do effectively is customize our approach for each student and adjust our methods to align with the learning profile of individual personalities and attributes, thus making patience, as well as strong listening and interpersonal skills, central to our success.  When we see students in person, tutoring is conducted in a quiet, casual atmosphere where we work one-on-one with elementary, middle school, and high school students for an hour at a time. Currently, we also provide home and school visits for students. Until we return to in-person tutoring, training and tutoring will take place online, so candidates are required to have reliable access to a laptop or desktop computer with camera, a printer, and consistent and strong internet service.  We have opportunities for candidates with availability to tutor as few as 6 hours a week to as many as 20-plus. We only accept applicants who can start immediately, have strong interpersonal skills, and are willing to make a firm commitment for the entirety of this school year (to the end of June of 2023).

The ideal applicant is flexible and will be comfortable teaching several subjects and/or tests, and also enjoy working with students of varying ages. Background working with children (such as camp counselor) is valuable, and competency in a wide range of subjects is a big plus.  This position is often a good fit for students enrolled in a graduate program, as well as those who have another focus, such as stay-at-home parents, artists, dancers, writers, waitstaff, etc. seeking part-time hours. As long as you can commit to consistent days and are punctual we will work with your schedule.  Along with your resume, please include a cover letter or email describing:  The specific subjects or tests you are comfortable teaching, e.g., English, history, calc, chem, biology, physics, SAT, ACT, etc. Your availability each day of the week, including times and explaining Saturday and Sunday availability The number of hours a week you would like to tutor Confirm you live in the New York City area Your ability to commit to the end of the school year in June of 2023 We offer highly competitive compensation and flexible hours but, more importantly, an environment in which we support and respect our instructors and strive to make our work with students fun and satisfying.

We are passionate about teaching people how to have more resources come into our communities to make a difference.  Some of the Free Not-For-Profit 501(c)8 Programs:  -Community Grants: funding to plan and organize, hands on, one day volunteer activities in your community, multiple times per year - up to $2000 max. (Ex: care packages, back to school drives/giveaways, food drives, clothing drives, hygiene kits)  -Online Learning Enrichment Programs: Over 200 Courses (Microsoft courses, Cyber security, Biz management, Project Management, Technology, Finance (understanding your 401k/IRA, Retirement planning).  -Parental Legacy Program: Gives $900 per month per child in child support & $24,000 for high education per child, if orphaned.  -Scholarship Program: 300+ Scholarships given away annually- $10,000 each ($2500 for 4 years)  -Fun Family Events: Allows you to apply to go to fun attractions for free with your family and other local policy owners (Ex: Kings Dominion, Busch Gardens, Six Flags, Regional Baseball or basketball games, The Zoo or Aquarium, etc.)  All of these programs cost the individual absolutely nothing. That is why knowledge is so important to our community We believe everyone should know about this. Unfortunately, the percentage in the actual community that is aware of this, is less than 1%. We desire to change that... significantly. And make a difference in our community.   We have been in operation over 13 years, serving our community. The need is great, so we are looking for help. This is a 1099 position (independent and completely flexible schedule based on when you want to work).This position is best for people looking for part time work.

We are passionate about teaching people how to have more resources come into our communities to make a difference.   Some of the Free Not-For-Profit 501(c)8 Programs:   -Community Grants: funding to plan and organize, hands on, one day volunteer activities in your community, multiple times per year - up to $2000 max. (Ex: care packages, back to school drives/giveaways, food drives, clothing drives, hygiene kits)   -Online Learning Enrichment Programs: Over 200 Courses (Microsoft courses, Cyber security, Biz management, Project Management, Technology, Finance (understanding your 401k/IRA, Retirement planning).   -Parental Legacy Program: Gives $900 per month per child in child support & $24,000 for high education per child, if orphaned.   -Scholarship Program: 300+ Scholarships given away annually- $10,000 each ($2500 for 4 years)   -Fun Family Events: Allows you to apply to go to fun attractions for free with your family and other local policy owners (Ex: Kings Dominion, Busch Gardens, Six Flags, Regional Baseball or basketball games, The Zoo or Aquarium, etc.)   All of these programs cost the individual absolutely nothing.
