I've been on both sides of business. I spent 13 years taking all of the money I made bartending and dumping it into a business model that wasn't built for the average person to succeed only to fail 12 times. I finally gave up on the idea of being my own boss and got a ""real job"". That lasted about 6 months until a guy came into the bar and introduced me to lucky #13. This one was different, it was so different that I didn't understand it. All I knew is what I saw which was a room full of people making money which I had never seen before so I started my business and the rest is history. This business has allowed my wife and I to create a six-figure residual/ongoing income and help a lot of others along the way.   If you are open to the idea of being your own boss, are coachable and willing to follow a proven business plan part-time (8-15 hours/week) then please call/text me and I will get you more information. Serious inquiries only please. My wife and I can only work with one new business partner each quarter. For immediate consideration, submit a resume and contact information.  Ty 262-617-2726"

Anyone would be lucky to have you.      But not everywhere has been serving tasty cocktails in Milwaukee since 1976.   Lots of places won't pay you at least $12 per hour plus tips.   Not everywhere has our reputation for food, service and fun.   You don't get the chance to serve guests and drinks at Milwaukee's most beautiful and exclusive venues working with just anybody.      Part of the magic that Saz’s Catering brings to events is through delicious signature cocktails, champagne toasts and wine paired with our tasty menus. Every event is a little different, but our rockstar bartenders provide stellar service to our guests at weddings and social events, corporate parties and picnics, galas and fundraisers at so many of the area’s favorite venues. Our bartenders make sure bars are set up for success, service guests and make sure all of our partner event spaces are left just how we found them.      You could bartend anywhere. But you should do it here.    Requirements  Consistent Friday and/or Saturday availability required. Lots of beverage magic happens on the weekend.      We need folks on our team who know the ropes and their way around the bar. Some previous bartending experience is going to be required.      A valid, unexpired bartender's license or the completion of Wisconsin Responsible Beverage Server Certification course are required for employment.      Essential job functions:   Must be at least 18 years of age  Consistent, regular attendance as scheduled  Must be able to provide reliable transportation to and from events, since many will require meeting the event team on-site  Stand and walk up to 12 hours at a time  Lift and easily maneuver items up to 25 lbs to chest level or higher  Communicate verbally and read English    We're proud to be a five-time recipient of the Top Workplace award, and we want to show you why!

https://milwaukee.craigslist.org/fbh/d/milwaukee-catering-team-for-events/7554711583.html,Catering Team for Events!,milwaukee,fbh,"QR Code Link to This Post   Saz’s Catering prides itself on providing unexpectedly, over-the-top service to every guest, every time, at every event from black tie galas to corporate lunches to fairy tale weddings. Our crack catering team works service magic, sharing that passion with every plate.      Full and part time teams of caterers and servers work together to exceed all guest needs for casual and formal events in the areas’ favorite venues including indoor and outdoor spaces throughout Milwaukee and beyond.    Requirements  How do they share that magic, you ask? Here’s how:   Make guests needs #1.  Looks sharp and be charismatic. You’re the face of Saz’s Catering!  Be a team player. We’re all in it together and can’t make it happen alone. No ambassador (or chef or Event Manager) is an island.  Communicate! To keep everyone on the same page and things rolling smoothly, Ambassadors need to keep others in the loop, ask good questions and listen to the answers.  Think on your feet. Off-site catering is ever-changing and can be unpredictable, even with the best laid plans and top-notch preparations.  Okay, but what does a team of caterers and servers do?   Prepare, setup and tear down events.  Provide guest service including filling glasses, serving or clearing plates, refilling and monitoring the buffet.  Answer guest questions and respond to their needs.  Keep the event space and equipment neat, tidy and clean.  Requirements What do I need to join the team for this summer's events?   Passion for service. “The Finest” service. Each plate, every interaction, any question. Our guests’ needs are first.  Excellence. Whether it’s folding napkins, taking the temperature of food, or loading a truck, the details are what sets Saz’s Catering apart.  Stamina. Being a Catering Ambassador or Server can mean long shifts on your feet, moving fast and carrying equipment, food or beverages.  Team spirit. Only together can Saz’s Catering wow our guests, up our game and continue to grow. We need you to cheer for your team and support one another.  A drivers’ license is helpful, but not required.  What you don’t need is food service experience, as a caterer or server. It’d be great and help you hit the ground running, but if you can show you’ve got the rest, we’ll provide on-the-job training to get you up to speed. Just want to pick up a few shifts here and there to bring in some extra funds? We can accommodate ""sometimes"" schedules and ""all the time"" schedules to fit your needs and ours. Our Banquet Servers start at $13 per hour and our Catering Ambassadors make no less than $14 per hour, based on experience.    We're proud to be a five-time recipient of the Top Workplace award, and we want to show you why!

https://milwaukee.craigslist.org/fbh/d/delafield-looking-for-something-new/7553121995.html,Looking for something new?,milwaukee,fbh,"QR Code Link to This Post   Tired of the job you've got, or are you waking up every day dreading the drive to a job you know is going to ruin your day? Hating that gig where you're on your feet all day, in a hot building, maybe dealing with people who don't care about you or actively enjoy making you miserable? Tired of working for people who talk down to you and customers who couldn't be bothered to give you even the basic level of respect or human decency?  Well, I get the feeling that we can help each other out. You're someone who isn't dumb, someone who, when they're given a task that they care about, they make sure to do a good job, and you're hopefully someone who's willing to try something they might not have any experience in. We're Kar-Tech, a manufacturer that specializes in wireless control systems, a company that is growing like mad and needs folks to help us meet all that demand, and a company that's been around for over 25 years and has employees that have been with us almost that entire time (and who's going to stick with a job that long if the folks they work for suck, right?)  We're looking for folks to help us with Light Assembly, Kitting/Receiving, and Electrical testing. We know not everyone out there has years of experience soldering tiny components, finding parts to go with jobs, or creating wiring harnesses, and that's totally fine. If you can promise us you'll show up every day, willing to learn and eager to show you care about your work, we can teach you all the skills you need. And we're going to go way out of our way to make it super clear we're happy you keep coming back.  The mantra we work with is if you can come in every day and show us that you care about the work you're doing, we can make sure you learn the skills to absolutely kick ass here.  So here's those nitty gritty details that really matter. We're located in Delafield, and our production floor runs from 7 AM - 3:30 PM, Monday through Friday. We won't hire anyone for less than $15/hr, but if you've got the skills or experience to merit it, we're willing to go above that, potentially way above it, and even if you don't odds are you won't be making $15 for long. We've got medical, dental, vacation, 401k match, all that jazz, hell we even get pizza or bagels every other Friday or so."
